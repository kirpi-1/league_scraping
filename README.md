Mental Models and Expertise using Multiplayer Online Video Games. 
We've known since the 60s that experts and novices organize knowledge differently (Chase & Simmons. 1973). Knowledge structures are often studied by looking at the differences in the structure of mental models. Mental models are the lens by which we begin to reason, to understand the variables and interactions at play, and to anticipate how events may unfold when specific actions are engaged in a dynamic system (Dochy et al, 2003; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Segers, 1997). By studying the structural differences in mental models of novice and experts, researchers can better define what it means to be an expert and advise anywhere where expertise may be an influential factor (e.g., training). Previous work substantiated multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) style games as a valid domain to study mental model theory (Furlough & Gillan, 2018). The same work advances the inquiry of expertise from a binary investigation (novice vs. expert) to a 3 level investigation of expertise differentces. But until recently only one game has been employed within this genre. The current study seeks to extend this literature by investigating whether structural differences of mental models by expertise extends across MOBA and other multiplayer online games.
In this study, participants will be given a series of related rating items. They will be asked to compare how related key concepts are for a specific game (League of Legends, Dota2, or Overwatch). For example, a participant will see: How related is Tanking to Damage? They will mark on a 9 point scale how related the items are. There will be 20 related items per game, for a total of 60 related items across games. 
A structural assessment technique (Pathfinder) will be used to represent mental model structures (Schvaneveldt, 1990). Pathfinder creates a model or network based on participants' relatedness ratings of items in a given domain (Lim & Klein, 2006). Dependent measures such as total links, central nodes, subnetworks, etc. will be investgated for differences across experitse and gametype. 
# webscraping and relatedness items
Web scraping will be used to collect the related rating items needed for the study. We have determined that terms with a dedicated wiki page and high term frequencies throughout the wiki site are likely to be reflective of importance. Additionally, we are interested in words that are reflective of gameplay/game mechanics. To be selected as a concept for the study, concepts need to meet the following criteria. 
1) Concepts needed to be unique. When multiple concepts shared overlapping definitions (e.g., tank vs tanking in Dota2), a single concept was chosen.  
2) Concepts needed to be holistic. When concepts fell under the category of another concept, the category concept was chosen (e.g., items vs Redemption or Shurelyaâ€™s Reverie in League of Legends). 
3) Concepts needed to be related to elements and mechanics that directly contributed to overall gameplay (relevant vs irrelevant concept, e.g., turrets vs champion skins in League of Legends. 
4) Concepts excluded proper nouns (e.g., character names such as Rhine/Rhineheart from Overwatch). 
These criteria were used to include breadth of concepts that describe the game and were unique to gameplay. 
# project needs
1) Term frequency, specifically for words with their own wiki page as these are considered more important items 
2) Removal of common words like the, a, and, etc. 
3) Distance matrix (i.e. how far is the X-Word from the 1st word listed. 1st word listed can be considered the wiki page title.) 
4) A count for how frequently a pair of words appear on the same page

I will make sure to contact Freddy to get a list of words we think will be important to look for.
